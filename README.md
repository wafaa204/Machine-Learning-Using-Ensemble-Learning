This project explores three fundamental ensemble learning techniques in Machine Learning: Bagging, Boosting (AdaBoost), and Stacking.
Using the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn, the notebook walks through:

Building and training ensemble models

Tuning key hyperparameters and observing their impact

Comparing accuracy across different ensemble approaches

Experimenting with multiple base learners and meta-models

The notebook provides clean, well-commented code and a practical demonstration of how ensemble methods can significantly improve classification performance.
